# Simple-blog
 A simple blog app built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
Users can create, edit, delete and view blog posts. Includes title slug generation and custom layouts with EJS templating.

This project demonstrates a basic fullstack JavaScript web application with:

CRUD functionality for blog posts
Database storage using MongoDB and Mongoose
Server side rendering with EJS layouts and templates
Routing and controllers to handle requests
User input validation and sanitization
Password hashing for security
The codebase follows the MVC pattern and has comments for learning purposes. This app can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced blogs and content management systems.
